convert them automatically.

=========================================

In this release the documentation has been improved and a few bugs have been
fixed.

The file format has also been updated to decrease the risk of loosing data.
Users are therefore strongly encouraged to upgrade to this version. The file
format is readable by the 0.2.0 version but it can not take advantage of the
new format.

New features, enhancements:

  * Changed to allow events without categories.
  * Improved what's displayed in the title bar (open file name first).
  * Added application icon.
  * Added Help menu.
  * Converted user manual to DocBook format.
  * Integrated user manual with application (first step).
  * Started experimenting with unit tests.
  * Added copyright notes to all source files.
  * Added AUTHORS, CHANGES, COPYING, and INSTALL.

Bug fixes:

  * Fixed bug where application raised exceptions when scrolling to the very
    end or the very beginning of time (year 10 or year 9999).
  * If multiple timelines were opened, the displayed period would just be saved
    for the last opened one. That is fixed now so it is saved for all.
