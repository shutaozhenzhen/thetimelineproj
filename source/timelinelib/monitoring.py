Contains the Monitoring class.

The monitoring functions comes into action if the flag DEBUG_ENABLED,
in the :doc:`timelinelib module <timelinelib>`, is set to True. 
This happens if the application argument --debug is used at start of Timeline. 
When DEBUG_ENABLED is True, timer and counting statistics are shown 
in the main panel.

:doc:`Tests are found here <unit_monitoring>`.
