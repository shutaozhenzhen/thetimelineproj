The recommended way to install Timeline is with a binary package or installer.
If that is not available for your platform, instructions for installing from
source follows below.

Prerequisites
=============

Required:

  * Python version 2.4, 2.5, or 2.6
      http://www.python.org
  * wxPython version 2.8.8 or greater
      http://www.wxpython.org
  * Markdown version 1.7 or greater (for viewing help pages)
      http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/
  * iCalendar version 2.1 or greater (for working with ics files)
      http://pypi.python.org/pypi/icalendar/2.1

For translations (other than English) you also need the following:

  * SCons
      http://www.scons.org/
  * gettext version 0.17
      http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/

Extra development tools:

  * Mock version 0.6.0 (for running tests)
      http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/
  * Epydoc (for generating API documentation)
      http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/

Installing prerequisites on a Debian-based system
-------------------------------------------------

Note: If your version of wxPython is less than 2.8.8 you need to install a
newer version. Check out this wiki page for instructions how to do that:
http://wiki.wxpython.org/InstallingOnUbuntuOrDebian.

  apt-get install python python-wxgtk2.8 wx2.8-i18n python-markdown
  apt-get install scons gettext

You have to install iCalendar and Mock manually since there are no Debian
packages for them. See sections below.

Installing gettext on Windows
-----------------------------

Get the zipfiles gettext-tools-0.17.zip and gettext-runtime-0.17-1.zip from
here http://ftp.acc.umu.se/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/dependencies/.

Installing iCalendar
--------------------

The easiest way to install iCalendar is to download the source code from its
website and then copy the iCalendar-2.1/src/icalendar folder to the root folder
of Timeline. Or you can follow their installation instructions.

The important thing is that you can do 'import icalendar' from Python.

Installing Mock
---------------

The easiest way to install Mock is to download the python module from
http://www.voidspace.org.uk/downloads/mock.py and put it into the test
directory.

The important thing is that you can do 'import mock' from Python.
