This document contains some information that is useful when working with the
source code.

Commands
========

Useful commands to know about:

  * `scons --help` - Show available targets
  * `python tests/run.py` - Run all test in test suite
  * `python tools/*.py` - See comment in tools to learn what they do

Mercurial on Windows
====================

Windows users should use the Win32Text extension as described here:
<http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/Win32TextExtension>.

Coding Guidelines
=================

We try to follow the
[Style Guide for Python Code](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Other
guidelines and exceptions to the standard are listed here.

Multiline docstrings
--------------------

We prefer to write multiline docstrings like this:

    """
    One line summary.

    More comments...
    """

instead of like this:

    """One line summary.

    More comments...

    """

Strings
-------

We use the " character for strings. Not the ' character.

Order of blocks inside a module (.py file)
------------------------------------------

All top-level blocks should be separated with two blank lines. Methods inside a
class should be separated with one blank line.

  * Module docstring
  * Imports
  * Global variables
  * Classes
    * `__init__`
    * Public methods
    * Private methods
      * `_create_gui` (if it exists)
      * Event handlers (if they exist)
      * Others
  * Functions

Naming convention for private attributes
----------------------------------------

All methods inside a class that are not supposed to be called outside the class
should be marked private by prefixing it with one underscore.

All member variables should always be considered private but we don't append
any underscores. The preferred way to access a class' variable is to write a
get-method. In general member variables should never be directly accessed
outside a class.

Naming convention for event handlers
------------------------------------

`_(object)_on_(name of event)`

Examples:

  * `_btn_close_on_click`
  * `_window_on_close`

GUI components construction
---------------------------

All GUI components should construct the GUI in a method called
`_create_gui`. Should there be any need to call other methods to simplify
the creation of the GUI the preferred way is to make those methods inner
methods of `_create_gui`. Example:

    class MainPanel(wx.Panel):

        def __init__(self, parent):
            wx.Panel.__init__(self, parent)
            self._create_gui()

        def _create_gui(self):
            def create_something_complex():
                ...
            ...
            create_something_complex()
            ...

Handling events
---------------

All events should be hooked up in `_create_gui` using the `Bind` method
of the `wx.Window`. ID's should not be used for events. We prefer to pass an
object instead. Example:

    FileMenu = wx.Menu()
    item = FileMenu.append(wx.ID_ANY, "&Quit")
    self.Bind(wx.EVT_MENU, self.OnQuit, item)

ID's can be used for standard ID's.

Documentation supporting this:

  * [wx.EvtHandler API Documentation](http://www.wxpython.org/docs/api/wx.EvtHandler-class.html#Bind)
  * [wxPython Migration Guide](http://www.wxpython.org/migrationguide.php) (the "Binding events" part)

GUI Guidelines
==============

Guidelines for how the GUI should look like to conform to as many standards as possible.

Some good resources:

  * [When to use ellipsis after menu items](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/637683/when-to-use-ellipsis-after-menu-items)
  * [UI Style Guides](http://www.experiencedynamics.com/science-usability/ui-style-guides) (index with links to other style guides)

From the [GNOME guidelines](http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/1.0/menus.html):

> Label the menu item with a trailing ellipsis ("...") only if the command
> requires further input from the user before it can be performed. Do not add
> an ellipsis to items that only present a confirmation dialog (such as
> Delete), or that do not require further input (such as Properties,
> Preferences or About).

Commit messages guidelines
==========================

  * Try to limit the first line to a 79-character summary
  * If a ticket was fixed in this commit, include a message like "Fixed ticket #32" (example in r77)

Release Actions
===============

Describes the actions to make a source release.

Binary releases are created from source releases. Scripts in our other
repositories (win and deb) are used for those purposes.

Feature freeze
--------------

When all features for a version has been implemented in main we move the
development over to stable. Features for the next version can continue to be
developed in main.

  1. Move main repo to stable repo
     1. `cd stable`
     2. `hg pull ../main`
     3. `hg push`
  2. Notify developers of repo change
  3. Change versions numbers in main to denote the next version
     1. `README`, manpage, `version.py`

Stabilize stable
----------------

  1. Import translations from Launchpad
  2. Check that README, CHANGES, and INSTALL are up to date
  3. Run `python tools/release.py check` to find possible errors

Last changes
------------

  1. Update version.py so that DEV=False and commit
  2. Run `python tools/release.py` (look out for warning messages at the end)
  3. Try running the unzipped release to make a basic check that it works
  4. Tag with x.y.z

If there will be a bugfix release, the first change after the tag-commit should
be one were the version number is changed so that z is increased and DEV=True.

After
-----

  * Create a downloadable release on SF
  * Create binary packages
  * Write news on SF and Freshmeat
  * Close the milestone in Trac
  * Add the new version in Trac 

<!-- vim: set syntax=mkd: -->
