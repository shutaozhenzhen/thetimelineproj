"To add a new event at a specific point in time, double click somewhere on "

"clicked on.\n"
"\n"
"To add an event that spans over a period, hold the *Ctrl* key down, click "
"and drag the mouse to mark a period, and release the mouse button. Again the "
"event dialog box will display and you enter a text for the event and click "
"*OK*.  Now you will also see an event displayed under the horizontal line "
"spanning over the period that you selected.\n"
"\n"
"Events at a specific point in time will always be displayed above the "
"horizontal line. Events spanning over a period will be displayed below the "
"horizontal line most of the time.  However, if the period is to small to fit "

"line (zooming in will make the event jump from above to below).\n"

"To edit an event, double click on it and the event dialog box will appear.\n"
