A note about version numbers
----------------------------

Timeline uses a three-component version numbering system (X.Y.Z).

Z is only incremented when critical bugs are corrected or translations are
updated. The functionality of the program is the same for all X.Y versions.

Y is incremented every time a new feature or enhancement is added.

X is incremented when the new version is no longer compatible with previous
versions or when the program undergoes some big change or significant
milestone.

Release cycle
-------------

Roughly every third month there is a new feature release of Timeline (if new
features have been developed). That means that Y will increase by one.

If critical bugs are found in a X.Y release, we try to fix them as fast as
possible and make the fix available in a bugfix release (X.Y is the same but Z
is incremented by one).

Future plans
------------

Our highest priority is to fix critical bugs and annoyances. Those are usually
reported and discussed on the mailing list (:doc:`support`).
