<section>
<title>Tutorial</title>

<para>
The idea is to display events on a timeline and to be able to quickly change
what period in time is shown. An event can be at a specific point in time or
span over a period.
</para>

</title>
<graphic fileref="figures/zoom.png" />
</figure>

<para>
To create a new timeline, select <emphasis>New</emphasis> from the
<emphasis>File</emphasis> menu and enter a name of a file in the dialog box
that opens. This is the name of the file in which information about your events
will be stored. Next time you start Timeline you can choose to open the same
file again.
</para>

<para>
To add a new event at a specific point in time, double click somewhere on the
timeline. This will open a dialog box in which you enter a text for the event.
Click the <emphasis>OK</emphasis> button to save the event. Now you will see an
event above the horizontal line at the specific point in time that you double
clicked on.
</para>

<para>
<emphasis>
Timeline automatically saves all changes for you so you never need to manually
save your timeline.
</emphasis>
</para>

<para>
To add an event that spans over a period, hold the
<emphasis>Ctrl-key</emphasis> down, click and drag the mouse to mark a period,
and release the mouse button. Again the event dialog box will display and you
enter a text for the event and click <emphasis>OK</emphasis>.  Now you will
also see an event displayed under the horizontal line spanning over the period
that you selected.
</para>

<para>
Events at a specific point in time will always be displayed above the
horizontal line. Events spanning over a period period will be displayed below
the horizontal line most of the time.  However, if the period is to small to
fit within a few pixels on the screen, it will be displayed above the
horizontal line (zooming in will make the event jump from above to below).
</para>

<para>
To edit an event, double click on it and the event dialog box will appear.
</para>

<para>
To select an event, just click on it. To select multiple events, hold down the
<emphasis>Ctrl-key</emphasis> while selecting events. To delete the selected
events, press the <emphasis>Del-key</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
Try the mouse wheel and you will see the timeline scroll.
</para>

<para>
Try pressing the left mouse button and drag and you will see the timeline
scroll.
</para>

<para>
Try the mouse wheel while holding the <emphasis>Ctrl-key</emphasis> down and
you will see the timeline zoom.
</para>

<para>
The vertical red line indicates the current time.
</para>

<para>
Hoovering an event will display the full description in the status bar.

<title>Editing Events</title>

<para>
Editing event information is done in the dialog shown below.
</para>

<figure>
<title />
<graphic fileref="figures/event_editor.png" />
</figure>

<para>
It is used both for creating new events and for editing existing ones.
</para>

<para>
The <emphasis>Create Event</emphasis> dialog can be opened in the
following ways:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
Select the menu <emphasis>File -&gt; Create Event</emphasis>.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
Double click with the left mouse button on the timeline.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
Press the <emphasis>Ctrl-key</emphasis>, thereafter hold left mouse button down
on the timeline, drag the mouse and release it.
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
The <emphasis>Edit Event</emphasis> dialog can be opened by double clicking on
an event.
</para>

<para>
The following properties can be defined for an event:
</para>

<variablelist>
<title />
<varlistentry>
<term>Start</term>
<listitem>
<para>
This is the start time of the event if it spans a period, otherwise it is the
specific point in time. If used for a period, it has to be less or equal to the
end time.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>End</term>
<listitem>
<para>
This is the end time of the event if it spans a period. This is not used
otherwise. If used it has to be greater or equal to the start time.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Text</term>
<listitem>
<para>
A free text describing the event.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Category</term>
<listitem>
<para>
If you have defined any categories (see section below) you can associate the
event with one of your categories. An event can only belong to one category.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>
The checkboxes at the top of the dialog work as following:
</para>

<variablelist>
<title />
<varlistentry>
<term>Period</term>
<listitem>
<para>
If checked, both the start and end time will be used to define the period that
the event spans. If unchecked only the start time will be enabled and it will
specify the specific point in time for the event.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Show time</term>
<listitem>
<para>
If checked, you can specify a time for the start and end time in addition to
the date. This is useful if you are editing events on a day level where the
time is also important. The time will default to 00:00 if not entered.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Close on OK</term>
<listitem>
<para>
If checked, the dialog will close when you click OK. Otherwise it will not.
This can be used to add multiple events without closing the dialog.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>

</section>

<section>
<title>Deleting Events</title>

<para>
One or more events can be deleted at the same time. To delete events you first
select them and thereafter press the <emphasis>Delete</emphasis> key.
</para>

<para>
Before the event is deleted the deletion must be acknowledged in the dialog box
that appears when the <emphasis>Delete</emphasis> key has been pressed.
</para>

<para>
An event is selected by clicking within the rectangle representing the event.
The event is deselected by clicking on it once again. To select more than one
event, hold the <emphasis>Ctrl-key</emphasis> down while selecting events.
</para>

</section>

<section>
<title>Categories</title>

<para>
Categories are used to group events. An event can belong to one and only one
category. All events that belong to the same category are displayed with the
same background color. The color to be used is defined by the category. You can
also choose to show or hide all events belonging to a category.
</para>

<para>
If no categories exist (as is the case when a new timeline is created) no
categories will be associated with events. But as soon as there is a category
an event must have one. (This might change in future versions so that you can
create events without associating a category to it. Or maybe associate a
default category.)
</para>

<para>
If you want to edit the categories you open the <emphasis>Edit
Categories</emphasis> dialog.  This is done by selecting the menu
<emphasis>Timeline -&gt; Edit Categories</emphasis>.  The dialog looks like
this:
</para>

<figure>
<title />
<graphic fileref="figures/edit_categories.png" />
</figure>

<para>
You create a new category by clicking the <emphasis>Add</emphasis> button and
thereafter filling in the attributes of the category in the dialog that
appears. The visible checkbox determines if the events belonging to that
category should be visible or not. This flag can also be modified in the
sidebar (<emphasis>View -&gt; Sidebar</emphasis>).
</para>

<figure>
<title>The Edit Category dialog.</title>
<graphic fileref="figures/edit_category.png" />
</figure>

<figure>
<title>
Showing the correspondence between the visible flag in the Edit Category dialog
and the sidebar.
</title>
<graphic fileref="figures/sidebar.png" />
</figure>

<para>
You delete a category by selecting it in the listbox and clicking the
<emphasis>Delete</emphasis> button.  You thereafter have to acknowledge the
delete in the dialog that appears.  When you delete a category, all the events
that belonged to this category are associated with the special category None.
</para>

<para>
To edit a category, just double click on it.
</para>

</section>

<section>
<title>Navigation Functions</title>

<para>
In addition to the basic navigation functions described in the tutorial there
are also a set of navigation functions in the <emphasis>Navigate</emphasis>
menu:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Go To Today</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Go To Date...</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Fit Year</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Fit Month</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Fit Day</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
<emphasis>Go To Today</emphasis> scrolls the timeline until the current date is
at the center of the screen.
</para>

<para>
<emphasis>Go To Date</emphasis> has the same functionality as <emphasis>Go To
Today</emphasis> with the exception that the user selects the date in a
dialog.
</para>

<figure>
<title>The Go to Date dialog.</title>
<graphic fileref="figures/goto_date.png" />
</figure>

<para>
The <emphasis>Show Time</emphasis> checkbox is used to enable or disable input
of time. The time will default to 00:00 if not entered. The timeline will be
centered at the date and time.  When the dialog is opened it is the date and
time at the center of the screen that is displayed.
</para>

<para>
<emphasis>Fit Year</emphasis> will expand or contract the timeline so that it
shows one whole year. The year shown is the year that is in the center of the
screen.
</para>

<para>
<emphasis>Fit Month</emphasis> and <emphasis>Fit Day</emphasis> has the same
functionality as the <emphasis>Fit Year</emphasis> except that the timeline
will display one single month and one single day.
</para>
