    <title>Tutorial</title>

    <para>
      The idea is to display events on a timeline and to be able to quickly
      change what period in time is shown. An event can be at a specific point
      in time or span over a period.
    </para>

    <figure>
      <title>
        Showing the two different types of events (cursor hoovering blue
        event).

      <graphic fileref="figures/events.png" />
    </figure>

    <figure>
      <title>
        Showing the same timeline as above but with a different zoom level.
      </title>
      <graphic fileref="figures/zoom.png" />
    </figure>

    <para>
      To create a new timeline, select <guimenuitem>New</guimenuitem> from the
      <guimenu>File</guimenu> menu and enter a name of a file in the dialog box
      that opens. This is the name of the file in which information about your
      events will be stored. Next time you start &app; you can choose to open
      the same file again. The titlebar always shows which timeline is
      currently opened.
    </para>

    <para>
      To add a new event at a specific point in time, double click somewhere on
      the timeline. This will open a dialog box in which you enter a text for
      the event.  Click the <guibutton>OK</guibutton> button to save the event.
      Now you will see an event above the horizontal line at the specific point
      in time that you double clicked on.
    </para>

    <note>
      <para>
        &app; automatically saves all changes for you so you never need to
        manually save your timeline.
      </para>
    </note>

    <para>
      To add an event that spans over a period, hold the <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
      key down, click and drag the mouse to mark a period, and release the
      mouse button. Again the event dialog box will display and you enter a
      text for the event and click <guibutton>OK</guibutton>.  Now you will
      also see an event displayed under the horizontal line spanning over the
      period that you selected.
    </para>

    <para>
      Events at a specific point in time will always be displayed above the
      horizontal line. Events spanning over a period will be displayed below
      the horizontal line most of the time.  However, if the period is to small
      to fit within a few pixels on the screen, it will be displayed above the
      horizontal line (zooming in will make the event jump from above to
      below).
    </para>

    <para>
      To edit an event, double click on it and the event dialog box will
      appear.
    </para>

    <para>
      To select an event, just click on it. To select multiple events, hold
      down the <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> key while selecting events. To delete the
      selected events, press the <keycap>Delete</keycap> key.
    </para>

    <para>
      Try the mouse wheel and you will see the timeline scroll.

    <para>
      Try pressing the left mouse button and drag and you will see the timeline
      scroll.

      <title>Backups</title>

      <para>
        &app; tries its best to ensure that the data you save in a timeline
        never gets lost. One step in that process is to create a backup of
        your timeline every time before new data is saved. The backup is
        saved in a file with the same name as the original but with an "~"
        appended to the name.
      </para>

      <para>
        If you get an error saying that there was a problem reading
        timeline data, your backup might save you if the original has been
        corrupted.
      </para>

      <para>
        To recover a file from the backup, simply remove the "~" in the name of
        the backed up file.
      </para>

      <para>
        If you would like to be extra certain to not loose your data, we
        recommend that you take regular backups of your timeline file. It can be
        as simple as copying the original file to another directory.

            drag the mouse and release it.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>
        The <guilabel>Edit Event</guilabel> dialog can be opened by double
        clicking on an event.
      </para>

      <para>
        The following properties can be defined for an event:
      </para>

      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term><guilabel>Start</guilabel></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              This is the start time of the event if it spans a period,
              otherwise it is the specific point in time. If used for a period,
              it has to be less or equal to the end time.
            </para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
          <term><guilabel>End</guilabel></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              This is the end time of the event if it spans a period. This is
              not used otherwise. If used it has to be greater or equal to the
              start time.
            </para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
          <term><guilabel>Text</guilabel></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              A free text describing the event.

        <varlistentry>
          <term><guilabel>Category</guilabel></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              If you have defined any categories (see section below) you can
              associate the event with one of your categories. An event can
              only belong to one category.
            </para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
      </variablelist>

      <para>
        The checkboxes at the top of the dialog work as follows:
      </para>

      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term><guilabel>Period</guilabel></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              If checked, both the start and end time will be used to define
              the period that the event spans. If unchecked only the start time
              will be enabled and it will specify the specific point in time
              for the event.
            </para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
          <term><guilabel>Show time</guilabel></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              If checked, you can specify a time for the start and end time in
              addition to the date. This is useful if you are editing events on
              a day level where the time is also important. The time will
              default to 00:00 if not entered.
            </para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
          <term><guilabel>Close on OK</guilabel></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              If checked, the dialog will close when you click OK. Otherwise it
              will not.  This can be used to add multiple events without
              closing the dialog.
            </para>

      <title>Deleting Events</title>

      <para>
        One or more events can be deleted at the same time. To delete events
        you first select them and thereafter press the
        <keycap>Delete</keycap> key.
      </para>

      <para>
        Before the event is deleted the deletion must be acknowledged in the
        dialog box that appears when the <keycap>Delete</keycap> key has
        been pressed.
      </para>

      <para>
        An event is selected by clicking within the rectangle representing the
        event.  The event is deselected by clicking on it once again. To select
        more than one event, hold the <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> key down while
        selecting events.
      </para>

    </section>

    <section>

      <title>Categories</title>

      <para>
        Categories are used to group events. An event can only belong to one
        category.  All events that belong to the same category are displayed
        with the same background color. The color to be used is defined by the
        category. You can also choose to show or hide all events belonging to a
        category.
      </para>

      <para>
        If you want to edit the categories you open the <guilabel>Edit
          Categories</guilabel> dialog. This is done by selecting
        <menuchoice>
          <guimenu>Timeline</guimenu>
          <guimenuitem>Edit Categories</guimenuitem>
        </menuchoice>
        from the menu. The dialog looks like this:
      </para>

      <figure>
        <title>Categories Editor.</title>
        <graphic fileref="figures/edit_categories.png" />
      </figure>

      <para>
        You create a new category by clicking the <guibutton>Add</guibutton>
        button and thereafter filling in the attributes of the category in the
        dialog that appears. The visible checkbox determines if the events
        belonging to that category should be visible or not. This flag can also
        be modified in the sidebar
        (<menuchoice>
          <guimenu>View</guimenu>
          <guimenuitem>Sidebar</guimenuitem>
        </menuchoice>).
      </para>

      <figure>
        <title>The Edit Category dialog.</title>
        <graphic fileref="figures/edit_category.png" />
      </figure>

      <figure>
        <title>
          Showing the correspondence between the visible flag in the Edit
          Category dialog and the sidebar.
        </title>
        <graphic fileref="figures/sidebar.png" />
      </figure>

      <para>
        You delete a category by selecting it in the listbox and clicking the
        <guibutton>Delete</guibutton> button or pressing the
        <keycap>Delete</keycap> key.  You thereafter have to acknowledge the
        delete in the dialog that appears.  When you delete a category, all the
        events that belonged to this category are no longer associated with a
        category.
      </para>

      <para>
        To edit a category, just double click on it.
      </para>

      <para>
        Sometimes you forget what color you assigned to a category. To get a
        quick overview of the active categories you can show the legend
        (<menuchoice>
          <guimenu>View</guimenu>
          <guimenuitem>Legend</guimenuitem>
        </menuchoice>).
        The legend sits in the lower left corner of the timeline and shows the
        categories used by events in the current view and the color associated
        with them. This feature is especially useful when you export the
        timeline to an image.
      </para>

      <title>Navigation Functions</title>

      <para>
        In addition to the basic navigation functions described in the tutorial
        there are also a set of navigation functions in the
        <guimenu>Navigate</guimenu> menu:
      </para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><guimenuitem>Go To Today</guimenuitem></para></listitem>

        <listitem><para><guimenuitem>Fit Day</guimenuitem></para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>
        <guimenuitem>Go To Today</guimenuitem> scrolls the timeline until the
        current date is at the center of the screen.
      </para>

      <para>
        <guimenuitem>Go To Date</guimenuitem> has the same functionality as
        <guimenuitem>Go To Today</guimenuitem> with the exception that the user
        selects the date in a dialog.
      </para>

      <figure>
        <title>The Go to Date dialog.</title>
        <graphic fileref="figures/goto_date.png" />
      </figure>

      <para>
        The <guilabel>Show Time</guilabel> checkbox is used to enable or
        disable input of time. The time will default to 00:00 if not entered.
        The timeline will be centered at the date and time.  When the dialog is
        opened it is the date and time at the center of the screen that is
        displayed.
      </para>

      <para>
        <guimenuitem>Fit Year</guimenuitem> will expand or contract the
        timeline so that it shows one whole year. The year shown is the year
        that is in the center of the screen.
      </para>

      <para>
        <guimenuitem>Fit Month</guimenuitem> and <guimenuitem>Fit
          Day</guimenuitem> has the same functionality as the <guimenuitem>Fit
          Year</guimenuitem> except that the timeline will display one single
        month and one single day.
      </para>

    </section>

    <section>

      <title>Export to Image</title>

      <para>
        Sometimes you want to take your timeline and use it somewhere else. For
        example include it in an OpenOffice document or put it on a website.
        The Export to Image feature
        (<menuchoice>
          <guimenu>File</guimenu>
          <guimenuitem>Export to Image...</guimenuitem>
        </menuchoice>)
        lets you save the current view of the
        timeline as an image on disk. The default format is PNG. Other
        supported formats are BMP.
      </para>

    <section>

      <title>Enable Logging</title>

      <para>
        If you are having a problem with &app; it can be helpful to enable
        logging to get more information about your problem.
      </para>

      <para>
        In order to enable logging, &app; must be started from the command
        line like this:
      </para>

      <screen>
        <userinput>
          python &lt;path-to-timeline-directory&gt;/src/main.py --log-level 0 --log-file log.txt
        </userinput>
      </screen>

      <para>
        Windows users might also need to specify the path to the python exe
